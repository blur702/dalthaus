# Legacy UI Removal Complete

## What Was Done

1. **Stopped the legacy HTML frontend server** on port 3000
2. **Created a redirect server** that automatically redirects all traffic from port 3000 to the new React Material UI frontend on port 3002
3. **Legacy files preserved** but no longer served directly

## Current Setup

### Port 3000 â†’ Redirects to Port 3002
- All requests to http://localhost:3000 now receive a 301 redirect to http://localhost:3002
- Users are automatically sent to the new Material UI React frontend

### Active Frontends
- **Public Frontend**: http://localhost:3002 (React + Material UI)
- **Admin Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (React + Material UI)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001

## Benefits
- Single modern UI implementation
- Consistent Material UI design across all frontends
- No confusion between legacy and new implementations
- Automatic migration for users still using old URLs

## Redirect Server Details
- File: `public_html/redirect-server.js`
- Uses native Node.js http module
- Returns 301 permanent redirect
- Preserves URL paths during redirect

## Testing the Redirect
```bash
# Test redirect
curl -I http://localhost:3000
# Returns: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: http://localhost:3002/
```

## Legacy Files
The legacy HTML files are preserved in `public_html/public-frontend/` but are no longer served. They can be safely removed after confirming all functionality has been migrated.
