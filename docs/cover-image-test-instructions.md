# Cover Image Functionality Test Instructions

## What was implemented:

### Backend Changes:
1. ✅ Added `coverImageUrl` field to the BaseContent model (supports all content types)
2. ✅ Database schema updated to include the new field
3. ✅ Updated public API routes to return `coverImageUrl` in responses
4. ✅ Controllers automatically handle the new field (no changes needed)

### Frontend Admin Changes:
1. ✅ Added cover image URL input field to ContentEditor component
2. ✅ Field is available for all content types (articles, pages, photobooks)
3. ✅ Field appears right after title/slug fields for easy access

### Public Frontend Changes:
1. ✅ Updated articles listing to use `coverImageUrl` first, then fallback to old methods
2. ✅ Updated photobooks listing to use `coverImageUrl` first, then fallback to old methods
3. ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing content

## How to Test:

### Step 1: Test Admin Interface
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/admin
2. Login with username: `admin`, password: `(130Bpm)`
3. Navigate to Content → Articles or Content → Photo Books
4. Click "Add New" or edit existing content
5. You should see a "Cover Image URL" field after the Title/Slug fields
6. Enter a test image URL like: `https://via.placeholder.com/400x300?text=Test+Cover`
7. Fill in other required fields and save

### Step 2: Test Public Frontend
1. Go to http://localhost:3001 (public frontend)
2. Navigate to Articles or Photo Books sections
3. Content with cover images should display them in the listings
4. If no cover image is set, it falls back to:
   - Featured image from metadata (for backward compatibility)
   - First image found in content
   - Placeholder image

### Step 3: API Verification
Test the API endpoints directly:

```bash
# Get articles (should include coverImageUrl field)
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/public/articles"

# Get photobooks (should include coverImageUrl field)
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/public/photobooks"
```

## Benefits of this implementation:

1. **Universal**: Works for all content types (articles, pages, photobooks)
2. **Backward Compatible**: Existing content still works
3. **Flexible**: Accepts any valid image URL
4. **Fallback Support**: If no cover image is set, it uses smart fallbacks
5. **Easy to Use**: Simple URL input field in admin interface

## Example URLs for testing:
- `https://via.placeholder.com/400x300?text=Article+Cover`
- `https://via.placeholder.com/500x400?text=Photobook+Cover`
- `https://picsum.photos/400/300`

## Notes:
- Cover images are displayed in listings/previews, not in individual content views
- The field accepts any valid URL - no file upload functionality
- Images should be optimized for web display (reasonable file size)
- The field is optional - content works fine without cover images
