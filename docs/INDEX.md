## üí° Key Points to Remember

1. **The system is fully functional** - Authentication, user management, and content management all work
2. **Modular architecture** - Features are isolated for easy extension
3. **Security is implemented** - JWT auth, role-based access, password hashing
4. **Database uses single table inheritance** - All content types share one table
5. **Frontend and backend are separate** - API on port 5001, dev frontend on 5173

## üîë Critical Information

- **Admin Login**: username: `admin`, password: `(130Bpm)`
- **Database Config**: `/var/www/config/database.json`
- **Project Root**: `/var/www/public_html/`
- **Backend Port**: 5001
- **Frontend Dev Port**: 5173

## üìù Summary for Next Instance

- Secure authentication system
- Complete user management
- Flexible content management system
- Modular, extensible architecture
- Comprehensive documentation
